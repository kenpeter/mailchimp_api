As the test task, can you please implement MailChimp API v3 with the following functionality:


Creating new list(s)



Adding new member(s) to the list


Updating/modifying member(s) within a list



MailChimp API uses RESTful architecture, so I would recommend using Guzzle PHP library to consume their API.
