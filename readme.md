## Intro

Some (hardcoded) scripts to play around with Guzzle and Mailchimp api.

## Run
1. git clone this project. Under ./src
2. php display_list.php, to display all lists.
3. php create_new_list.php, to create a new list.
4. php create_new_member.php, to create a new member. (we grab the list id, from No.3)
5. php update_existing_member.php, to update new member. (we grab the list id and member id, from No.3 and No.4)

## ./test directory
Some scripts I play around.

## ./lib directory
A php class, it may not be necessary, but it is used anyway.
